# Flight-Fare-Prediction-
In our Model we had incomplete price value which are to be predicted , we  transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables (Nan). All the  collected data needed a lot of work so after the collection of data, it is needed to  be clean and prepare according to the model requirements. All the unnecessary  data is removed like duplicates and null values. We also split the data into train  and tests sets which has price dummy variables to predict. Already which has  price is split as train set. We tried regression models and evaluated the using Root  Mean Squared Error.
